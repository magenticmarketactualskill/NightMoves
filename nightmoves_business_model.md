### 4.2. Transaction Fees and Revenue Sharing

A key component of the NightMoves revenue model is a transaction fee applied to all licensing agreements facilitated through the platform. This fee is structured to be competitive and transparent, ensuring that developers receive the majority of the revenue they generate. The proposed revenue sharing model is an 85/15 split, where **85% of the licensing revenue goes to the developer(s)** and **15% is retained by NightMoves** as a platform fee. This is in line with industry standards, such as the Adobe Commerce Marketplace [1].

This revenue sharing model directly implements the shared value concept by creating a direct financial incentive for developers to contribute high-quality, in-demand software. As developers earn more, the platform's revenue also grows, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and value creation.

NightMoves will operate under a transparent and democratic governance model, inspired by successful open-source projects like the Linux Foundation [2]. The governance structure will be designed to ensure that the platform evolves in a way that benefits the entire community, not just a single entity. The key elements of the governance framework include:

- **NightMoves Foundation:** A non-profit foundation will be established to oversee the governance of the platform. The foundation will be responsible for managing the platform's intellectual property, financial reserves, and the election of the governing board.
- **Governing Board:** The board will be composed of elected representatives from the developer community, enterprise customers, and the NightMoves core team. The board will be responsible for setting the strategic direction of the platform, approving major changes to the platform, and resolving disputes.
- **Technical Steering Committee:** A technical committee, composed of respected developers from the community, will be responsible for the technical roadmap of the platform, including the approval of new features and changes to the core architecture.

### 5.2. Licensing Model

The licensing framework is a critical component of the NightMoves business model. It must provide legal clarity and protection for both developers and enterprises. NightMoves will employ a **dual-licensing model**, a strategy successfully used by companies like MySQL [3].

- **Community License:** Code contributed by developers will be available under a permissive open-source license (e.g., Apache 2.0). This allows for broad adoption and community collaboration.
- **Commercial License:** Enterprises that wish to use the software in proprietary applications or require additional legal protections and warranties will be required to purchase a commercial license. The terms of the commercial license will be standardized to ensure clarity and consistency.

This dual-licensing approach provides a clear path for developers to contribute to the platform while also creating a straightforward mechanism for enterprises to use the software in a commercially supported environment.

## 6. Conclusion

NightMoves presents a compelling business model that addresses a significant need in the software development industry. By creating a collaborative ecosystem built on shared value and open governance, NightMoves is poised to become a leading platform for both developers and enterprises.

## D.3. Commercial License

Enterprises that wish to use software from the NightMoves repository in their proprietary, closed-source products, or that require additional legal assurances and support, must purchase a **Commercial License**. The Commercial License is a proprietary agreement between the enterprise and NightMoves that provides rights and protections beyond those offered by the Apache License 2.0.

Key features of the Commercial License include the right to incorporate NightMoves software into closed-source, commercial products without the obligation to release the source code, a warranty of originality and non-infringement as well as indemnification against potential intellectual property claims, dedicated technical support and service level agreements (SLAs), and removal of copyleft restrictions that might be present in other open-source licenses. This comprehensive set of protections and rights makes the Commercial License attractive to enterprises that require legal certainty and commercial support.

## D.4. Supporting Shared Value

The dual-licensing model is integral to the shared value proposition of NightMoves. For developers, it provides a clear and direct path to monetization, as they receive a share of the revenue when an enterprise purchases a Commercial License for software they have contributed to. For enterprises, it provides a legally sound and commercially supported way to leverage the innovation of the open-source community while mitigating legal and security risks. For the platform, it creates a sustainable revenue stream that funds ongoing development and community growth. This alignment of interests ensures that all participants benefit from the success of the ecosystem.
