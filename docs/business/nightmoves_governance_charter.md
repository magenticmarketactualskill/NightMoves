# NightMoves Governance Charter

## 1. Mission and Principles

**Mission:** To build and sustain a collaborative software development ecosystem that empowers developers and provides exceptional value to enterprises through a commitment to fairness, transparency, and shared success.

**Core Principles:**

*   **Openness:** All governance processes, discussions, and decisions will be conducted openly and be publicly accessible.
*   **Transparency:** The reasoning behind major decisions will be clearly communicated to the community.
*   **Meritocracy:** Influence and leadership are earned through contribution and expertise, a principle often referred to as a "do-ocracy."
*   **Inclusivity:** The platform is committed to fostering a diverse and welcoming community where all voices can be heard.
*   **Shared Value:** The governance model will always seek to balance the interests of developers, enterprises, and the platform itself to ensure long-term sustainability and mutual benefit.

## 2. The NightMoves Foundation

A neutral, non-profit entity, the **NightMoves Foundation**, will be established to act as the legal steward of the platform. The Foundation's primary responsibilities include:

*   Holding the trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property of the NightMoves platform.
*   Managing the financial assets of the platform, including operational funds and community reserves.
*   Facilitating the election process for the Governing Board and Technical Steering Committee.
*   Serving as the final arbiter in legal and financial matters.

## 3. Governing Board

The **Governing Board** is the primary strategic decision-making body for the NightMoves platform.

### 3.1. Composition

The board will consist of **seven (7) members**, elected to serve two-year terms:

*   **Three (3) Developer Representatives:** Elected directly by the developer community.
*   **Two (2) Enterprise Representatives:** Elected by enterprise customers, with voting power proportional to their subscription tier.
*   **One (1) NightMoves Core Team Representative:** Appointed by the core development team of the platform.
*   **One (1) Community-at-Large Representative:** Elected by all registered members of the NightMoves community.

### 3.2. Responsibilities

*   Setting the overall strategic direction and vision for the platform.
*   Approving the annual budget and major financial decisions.
*   Overseeing the enforcement of the platform's policies and code of conduct.
*   Ratifying changes to the governance charter.
*   Appointing members to special-purpose committees as needed.

## 4. Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** is responsible for the technical oversight and direction of the NightMoves platform.

### 4.1. Composition

The TSC will consist of **five (5) members**, elected for their technical expertise and contributions to the platform:

*   The TSC members are elected by the active developer community (defined as developers who have made contributions in the past 12 months).
*   Candidates for the TSC must have a proven track record of significant technical contributions to the NightMoves ecosystem.

### 4.2. Responsibilities

*   Defining and maintaining the technical roadmap for the platform.
*   Establishing and enforcing coding standards, contribution guidelines, and review processes.
*   Making final decisions on architectural changes and the inclusion of new core features.
*   Resolving technical disputes and providing guidance on best practices.

## 5. Decision-Making Process

Decisions within the governance structure will be made with a preference for consensus. When a consensus cannot be reached, a simple majority vote will be used. All votes will be publicly recorded. Major decisions, such as changes to the governance charter or the revenue sharing model, will require a two-thirds majority vote of the Governing Board.

## 6. Conflict Resolution

Disputes within the community will first be addressed by the relevant committee (e.g., technical disputes by the TSC). If a resolution cannot be reached, the issue can be escalated to the Governing Board for a final decision.

## 7. Amendments

This charter can be amended by a two-thirds majority vote of the Governing Board. Proposed amendments must be published for community review and comment for a period of at least 30 days before a vote can be held.
