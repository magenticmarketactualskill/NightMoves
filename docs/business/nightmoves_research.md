# NightMoves Business Model Research

## Open Source Business Models Overview

### Key Business Model Categories

#### 1. Not Selling Code
- **Professional Services**: Training, technical support, consulting (RedHat, IBM, SUSE)
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Hosted solutions with subscription models
- **Voluntary Donations**: User-driven funding (GitHub Sponsors, SourceForge)
- **Crowdsourcing**: Community-driven development
- **Training and Certification**: Educational services

#### 2. Selling Users
- Advertising models
- User data monetization (controversial)

#### 3. Pre-selling Code
- Crowdfunding campaigns
- Pre-release access

#### 4. Selling Licensing Deals
- **Dual Licensing**: Open source + proprietary licenses (MySQL model)
- **Multi-licensing**: Multiple license options
- Enterprise licensing with SLAs

#### 5. Selling Proprietary Additives
- **Open Core Model**: Core open source + proprietary features
- Premium enterprise features
- Advanced functionality behind paywall

### Key Success Factors
- Conversion ratio typically <1% of downloaders to paying customers
- Low-cost, highly-scalable marketing and sales functions critical
- Service-level agreements (SLAs) for enterprise customers
- Enterprise-grade features and up-time guarantees

### Relevant Models for NightMoves
1. **Dual/Multi-licensing**: Developers contribute under open license, enterprises pay for commercial license
2. **Open Core**: Basic repositories free, advanced features (security, compliance, governance) paid
3. **Professional Services**: Support, integration, custom development
4. **SaaS Model**: Hosted repository platform with tiered pricing

## Next Research Areas
- Shared value frameworks
- Open governance models
- Collaborative development platforms
- Repository management systems


## Shared Value Framework (Porter & Kramer)

### Definition
Shared value represents "policies and practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing social and economic conditions in the communities in which it operates."

### Three Ways to Create Shared Value
1. **Reconceiving products and markets**: Meet social needs while serving existing/new markets or lowering costs through innovation
2. **Redefining productivity in the value chain**: Improve quality, quantity, cost, and reliability of inputs while stewarding natural resources and driving economic/social development
3. **Enabling local cluster development**: Companies thrive when their surrounding ecosystem (suppliers, infrastructure, talent, legal system) is strong

### Application to NightMoves
- **Reconceiving**: Platform enables developers to monetize their work while enterprises access quality code
- **Value chain**: Collaborative development improves code quality, reduces enterprise development costs
- **Cluster development**: Building a thriving developer ecosystem benefits all participants

## Open Source Governance Models

### 1. Do-ocracy
- "Those who do the work make the decisions"
- Authority based on contribution and effort
- Implicit governance through daily interactions
- **Challenge**: Can be intimidating for newcomers

### 2. Founder-Leader (BDFL)
- Founder maintains ultimate decision-making authority
- Clear lines of power and control
- **Challenge**: Can become bottleneck as project scales

### 3. Self-Selecting Councils
- Leadership groups (steering committee, technical council, etc.)
- Maintain own decision-making conventions
- **Challenge**: Can create self-reinforcing leadership cultures

### 4. Electoral
- Formal elections for roles and policies
- Common in larger projects with multiple qualified contributors
- Leads to precise documentation of roles and procedures
- **Challenge**: Can become contentious and time-consuming

### 5. Corporate/Consortium Backed
- Company or consortium controls project
- May require CLAs for contributions
- "Walled garden" approach
- **Challenge**: Can create mismatched expectations

### 6. Foundation Governed
- Managed by non-profit or trade association
- Ensures no single participant has exclusive control
- Foundation may manage trademarks, events, while project leaders manage technical roadmap

### Recommended for NightMoves
**Hybrid Foundation + Electoral Model**
- Foundation manages platform, licensing, revenue distribution
- Electoral/council model for technical decisions
- Transparent governance charter
- Developer representation in decision-making


## Marketplace Revenue Sharing Models

### GitHub Sponsors
- 6% fee for organizational sponsorships (3% processing + 3% platform)
- Direct developer support model
- Payment processing covered initially to encourage adoption
- Over $40M distributed to open source developers

### Other Platform Revenue Shares
- **Adobe Commerce Marketplace**: 85/15 split (85% to provider, 15% to Adobe)
- **Atlassian Marketplace**: 0% for Forge apps up to $1M lifetime revenue (2026)
- **Square App Marketplace**: Seller referral and subscription revenue sharing
- **Salesforce AppExchange**: Revenue share varies by solution type

### Key Insights for NightMoves
- Industry standard platform fees: 6-15% of transaction value
- Processing fees typically 2-3%
- Successful platforms minimize friction for developers
- Transparent fee structures build trust
- Initial fee waivers can accelerate adoption

## FIBO Framework Relevance

FIBO provides structured ontology for:
- **Business entities**: Organizations, legal entities, functional roles
- **Relationships**: How entities relate and interact
- **Unambiguous definitions**: Machine-readable, logic-based concepts
- **Consensus-based**: Industry-reviewed common concepts

### Application to NightMoves
- Define clear ontology for: Developers, Enterprises, Repositories, Licenses, Contributions, Revenue
- Establish unambiguous relationships between actors and assets
- Create machine-readable governance and licensing framework
- Enable automated compliance and revenue distribution
