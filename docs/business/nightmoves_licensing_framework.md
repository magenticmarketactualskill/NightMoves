> This document details the licensing framework for the NightMoves platform, designed to provide legal clarity, protect intellectual property, and support the shared value business model.

# NightMoves Licensing Framework

## 1. Introduction

The NightMoves licensing framework is a cornerstone of the platform, designed to balance the open, collaborative spirit of the developer community with the commercial requirements of enterprise customers. The framework is built upon a **dual-licensing model**, a proven strategy for commercializing open-source software. This model provides distinct licenses for community and commercial use, ensuring legal clarity and flexibility for all participants.

## 2. The Dual-Licensing Model

The dual-licensing model allows NightMoves to offer its software under two different sets of terms and conditions. This approach enables the platform to foster a vibrant open-source community while generating revenue from enterprises that require the additional rights and protections of a commercial license.

### 2.1. Community License: Apache License 2.0

All code contributed to the NightMoves platform will be licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. This is a permissive, OSI-approved open-source license that is widely respected and understood in the software development community. The choice of the Apache License 2.0 is based on several key advantages:

*   **Permissive Nature:** It allows for the free use, modification, and distribution of the software, which encourages broad adoption and community participation.
*   **Patent Grant:** It includes an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users, which helps to protect users from patent infringement claims.
*   **Clarity and Standardization:** The Apache License 2.0 is a well-established and well-understood license, which reduces legal ambiguity for both developers and users.

Under the Community License, developers can freely contribute to and use the software within the NightMoves ecosystem, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.

### 2.2. Commercial License

Enterprises that wish to use software from the NightMoves repository in their proprietary, closed-source products, or that require additional legal assurances and support, must purchase a **Commercial License**. The Commercial License is a proprietary agreement between the enterprise and NightMoves that provides rights and protections beyond those offered by the Apache License 2.0.

Key features of the Commercial License include:

*   **Proprietary Use:** The right to incorporate NightMoves software into closed-source, commercial products without the obligation to release the source code.
*   **Warranty and Indemnification:** The Commercial License provides a warranty of originality and non-infringement, as well as indemnification against potential intellectual property claims, offering a critical layer of legal protection for enterprises.
*   **Dedicated Support:** Commercial licensees are entitled to dedicated technical support and service level agreements (SLAs), ensuring that they have access to timely assistance and issue resolution.
*   **No Copyleft Restrictions:** The Commercial License removes the copyleft provisions that might be present in other open-source licenses, providing greater flexibility for commercial use.

## 3. How the Model Supports Shared Value

The dual-licensing model is integral to the shared value proposition of NightMoves:

*   **For Developers:** It provides a clear and direct path to monetization. When an enterprise purchases a Commercial License for software a developer has contributed to, that developer receives a share of the revenue. This creates a powerful incentive for developers to create high-quality, commercially viable software.
*   **For Enterprises:** It provides a legally sound and commercially supported way to leverage the innovation of the open-source community. Enterprises can reduce their development costs and accelerate their time-to-market, while mitigating the legal and security risks often associated with open-source software.
*   **For the Platform:** It creates a sustainable revenue stream that funds the ongoing development and maintenance of the platform, as well as the growth of the community.

## 4. License Compliance and Enforcement

NightMoves will implement a robust system for tracking the usage of software from the repository and ensuring compliance with the licensing terms. This will include:

*   **Automated Scanning:** The platform will include tools to scan for the use of NightMoves software in enterprise applications to identify potential compliance issues.
*   **Clear Documentation:** All software in the repository will be clearly marked with its license, and the terms of both the Community and Commercial Licenses will be readily accessible.
*   **Community Education:** NightMoves will invest in educating both developers and enterprises about the licensing terms and the importance of compliance.

By providing a clear, fair, and transparent licensing framework, NightMoves can build a trusted ecosystem where both developers and enterprises can thrive.
